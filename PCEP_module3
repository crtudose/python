Let's help an online store with their new refund policy. In this store, you can return an item and get a refund in 2 cases:
1. Within 10 days from the day of purchase, given that you have not used the item, or
2. No matter when you bought it, when the item broke down through no fault of your own.
Write a program that first asks the user three questions and then informs them whether they can get a refund. Ask the following questions:
How many days ago have you purchased the item? << add a space at the end of this prompt
Have you used the item at all [y/n]?  << add a space at the end of this prompt
Has the item broken down on its own [y/n]?  << add a space at the end of this prompt
Based on the answers and the refund policy explained above, print either:
You can get a refund.
or:
You cannot get a refund.
Note: Use the "Run tests" button to check your solution and mark it as complete. Do NOT use the "Run code" button as it will most likely show an error if you use an input() statement.

if(is_broken == 'y' or (purchase_days_ago <= 10 and is_used == 'n')):
  print('You can get a refund.')
else:
  print('You cannot get a refund.')
