>>>>>> shadowing - when we call a function like here and we try to modify it, we can see that there is already a var outside the function
# a 2nd temporary var with the same name is created
# first var is local and the 2nd with the same name is global ; they are 2 diff var with 2 diff values 
# the local var inside the function shadows the global var
# if you define within function the variable as: global mysterious_var, the modification will affect it
# if we use lists or dictionaries, keep in mind that if we use functions like append, shadowing will not work (not the same case is in using tuples which immutable)

NONE VALUE
print_return = print('hello world')

none   >>> this describes a null value or no value (special value, not zero/false/emptystring)
